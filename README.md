# BayesianNetTutorial

This repo includes files for the tutorial at AAS meeting for Bayesian Neural Networks. There are three separate parts for this tutorial.
1. Linear Regression with variable noise
2. Bayesian Neural Network on Gravitational Wave Parameter Estimation
3. How to write TensorFLow code for training and evaluation (arbitrary mdoel and dataset)
